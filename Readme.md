# m2h

Markdown to HTML converter written in Zig. This is very opinionated and only supports a small subset of markdown syntax. This also has some magic features that I needed for my personal use case.


## TODO
- [ ] Sort blog content
- [ ] @@blog_list to support number of blog
- [ ] gen html should have date based folder structure
- [ ] Parse table
- [ ] fix table of content for table series
- [ ] fix sorting on table of content using index
- [ ] add support for @@include_html and @@include_html_data for some dynamism - so I don't need to create parser for each type of thing I want to support
