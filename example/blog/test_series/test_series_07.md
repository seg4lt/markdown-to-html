# Test Series 07 - Links and References

{{ @@blog_series_toc }}

## Inline Links

Here's an [inline link](https://example.com) in the middle of a sentence.

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com) for open source projects.

Check out [this repository](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) for the Zig programming language.

## Links with Titles

This is a [link with a title](https://example.com "Example Website") that shows on hover.

Here's another [link](https://ziglang.org "The Zig Programming Language") with descriptive text.

## Reference-Style Links (Converted to Inline)

Note: This markdown parser supports inline links only. Reference-style links are converted to inline format:

This is a [reference-style link](https://example.com "Example Website") that uses a reference.

You can also use [another reference](https://github.com "GitHub") in the same document.

And here's a [third reference](https://ziglang.org "Zig Language") for good measure.

## Auto-Link References

<https://example.com>

<user@example.com>

## Links in Lists

- [First link](https://example.com/page1)
- [Second link](https://example.com/page2)
- [Third link](https://example.com/page3)

## Links in Block Quotes

> Check out this [important resource](https://example.com) for more information.
> 
> Also see [this related link](https://example.com/related).

## Complex Link Patterns

Here's a link to [test series 01](../test_series/test_series_01.md) and [test series 02](../test_series/test_series_02.md).

You can find more examples in the [blog index](../index.md).
